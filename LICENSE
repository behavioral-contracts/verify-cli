WHY AGPL-3.0?

This license keeps the analyzer open while protecting against proprietary SaaS competitors:

✅ Anyone can use locally (free forever)
✅ Anyone can self-host (free forever)
✅ Anyone can modify and redistribute (open source)
✅ Companies can integrate into CI/CD (free forever)
❌ If you offer this as a SaaS, you MUST open source your modifications

KEY POINT: The AGPL "network use" clause means if you run this as a web service (SaaS),
you must provide the source code to your users.

This prevents vendors from taking our work, adding proprietary features, and offering
closed SaaS - which is exactly what happened to Redis (they used BSD license and lost
to AWS ElastiCache).

DUAL LICENSING NOTE:

As the copyright holders, Behavioral Contracts can offer this software under alternative

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:

Individual Developers:
✅ Use freely in your projects
✅ No restrictions for local use
✅ Contribute improvements back (open source)

Companies (Internal Use):
✅ Run in your CI/CD pipelines
✅ Self-host for your organization
✅ Modify for internal use
✅ No cost, no restrictions

Companies (SaaS Providers):
✅ You can build SaaS using this tool
❌ But you must open source your SaaS code (AGPL requirement)
⚠️ Or contact us for commercial licensing

Examples:
- Running in GitHub Actions: ✅ Fine (not SaaS)
- Self-hosting for your team: ✅ Fine (internal use)
- Building public SaaS like "ContractCheckr.com": ❌ Must open source OR get commercial license
- Integrating into closed-source IDE: ❌ Must open source IDE OR get commercial license

WHY NOT MIT OR APACHE?

MIT/Apache would allow competitors to:
1. Fork our code
2. Add proprietary features
3. Offer closed SaaS
4. Never contribute back

AGPL prevents this while keeping the tool free for everyone except those building
competing SaaS products.

We chose AGPL because:
- Proven by GitLab ($15B valuation, AGPL)
- Proven by Sentry ($3B valuation, similar model)
- Protects open source from cloud providers
- Encourages community contributions
- Ensures improvements flow back

COMPARISON TO OTHER LICENSES:

MIT (too permissive):
❌ Allows proprietary SaaS
❌ No obligation to contribute back
Result: AWS takes your work, makes money, contributes nothing

GPL v3 (better, but not enough):
✅ Requires source sharing
❌ Doesn't cover network use (SaaS loophole)
Result: SaaS providers can still close it off

AGPL v3 (what we chose):
✅ Requires source sharing
✅ Covers network use (closes SaaS loophole)
✅ Forces SaaS providers to open source
Result: Everyone benefits from improvements
